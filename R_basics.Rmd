## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# 'Vector - most basic object of R'
# Vector contains only homogenous objects
# List can contain hetrogenous objects

# 'Five types of atomic classes of objects :
# 1. numeric
# 2. integer
# 3. complex 
# 4. character 
# 5. logical


# numeric vector
x <- c(0.4,1.5) 
x # Auto printing
print(x) # explicit printing

attributes(x)

# creates numeric vector of length 4 and initial value as 0
x1 <- vector(mode = "numeric",
             length = 4)
x1

# character vector
y <- c('a','b')
y

y1 <- vector(mode = "character",
             length = 5)
y1

# logical vector
z <- c(T,F)
z

z1 <- vector(mode = "logical",
             length = 3)
z1


# complex vector
w <- c(1+2i, 3+7i)
w

w1 <- vector(mode = "complex",
             length = 4)
w1

# integer vector
u <- c(1L,3L)
v <- c(3:10)

u
v

u1 <- vector(mode = "integer",
             length = 5)
u1

#  vector coercion
a <- c(1,'a') # coerced to character
a

b <- c(T,1) # coerced to numeric
b

c <- c(T,'a') # coerced to character
c

d <- c(2L,3) # coerced to numeric
d


```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
